# ZenTube

Watch youtube videos without distraction.


Yes, there exists the *picture-in-picure* mode as well, but it is so intrusive. The window never get covered by other ones, you need to move the whole window to the side if you want to uncover the window of other activities.

With ZenTube, you create just a simple html with video embedded. With this:

* Watch video without any distraction.
* No intrusive way of Youtube picture-in-picture.
