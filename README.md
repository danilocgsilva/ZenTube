# ZenTube

Watch youtube videos without distraction.

Yes, there exists the *picture-in-picure* mode as well, but it is so intrusive. The window never get covered by other ones, you need to move the whole window to the side if you want to uncover the window of other activities.

With ZenTube, you create just a simple html with video embedded. With this:

* Watch video without any distraction.
* No intrusive way of Youtube picture-in-picture.

## How to use

You need first to generate the embedded link via youtube in the *share* options from the video.

Then, just use it in the command line (using npm, that must be installed in your environment).
```
npm run watch <embedded_link> <file_name>
```
